# Naval Survival
### alpha v0.1

an infinite runner game where you drive a submarine through terrain, avoiding naval mines, rocky terrain, torpedos and ships, all while staying hidden from ships above that will drop explosives into the water when you are near the surface.

`as of now, it's not endless, and ends very fast with no obstacles or anything keeping you from going to the surface.`

No current way to download as an EXE file, only way to play is through opening the project through Godot 4.1
To download with git (if you have it):
```
Open file explorer to where you want the game
Open a terminal in this directory
type "git clone https://github.com/1101206/naval_survival.git"
enjoy
```
